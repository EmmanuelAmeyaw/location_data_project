    "In this project, we seek to identify similar households based on their household expenditure patterns. Since the data is unlabeled, we will use a machine learning clustering algorithm for this task. In the deep learning framework, we will use AUTO-ENCODERS together with a clustering layer for grouping the households.  \n",

    "In this notebook, we will present both deep learning and non-deep learning algorithms for clustering our dataset. We will compare results of basic models such as kmeans clustering to more complex models such as HDBSCAN. We will also use both the original data set and a normalized dataset in the clustering analysis and compare the results. Lastly, we will use the SILHOUETTE COEFFICIENT as a performance indicator. \n",

    "We will also apply at least one additional iteration in the process model involving at least the feature creation task, in this case, Normalisation. PCA will only be used for visualizing our clusters and not for feature selection. "
